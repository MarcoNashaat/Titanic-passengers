This is Data on Titanic passengers provided by Kaggle 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic', I did some analysis on the data going through the whole wrangling process, with the main objective to find trends between those who survived the tragic event and who couldn't. I've done the analysis on a jupyter notebook(provided in html and ipynp format) and did some basic user interactive python script, which takes several user inputs and deal with them. Let me know, if you find something I can work on, to make the project more complete.
